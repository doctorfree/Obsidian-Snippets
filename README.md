## Usage

Any [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) viewer can be used to view this knowledge base. You can simply browse the repository and click on the individual markdown files at https://github.com/doctorfree/Obsidian-Snippets.git in any web browser. However, to view the inter-relationships between the many components, categories, and technologies documented here, we recommend using the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) knowledge base engine.

The repository contains the Obsidian theme `Doctorfree`. To use this theme with Obsidian:

- Clone or download the repository
    - `git clone https://github.com/doctorfree/Obsidian-Snippets.git`
- Create a new Obsidian vault from the folder created above
- Select the `Doctorfree` Obsidian theme
    - Go to `Settings -> Appearance -> Themes` in Obsidian
    - Select `Doctorfree` from the drop down menu of available themes

**[Note:]** Obsidian is free for personal non-commercial use but must be purchased in revenue generating operations (see the note on [Obsidian license restrictions](#obsidian-license-restriction) below).

### Markdown viewers

Recommended markdown viewers, available for all platforms and with many features:

- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
- [nb](https://xwmx.github.io/nb)

If Obsidian does not suit your needs, there are many free an open source markdown editors and viewers available for all platforms. Doctorfree uses the [nb](https://xwmx.github.io/nb/) command line and local web note-taking, bookmarking, archiving, and knowledge base application. Obsidian and nb work well together to provide a rich markdown editing, viewing, and management system. See the [Obsidian plus NB](#obsidian-plus-nb) section below for details.

Several excellent resources exist that provide lists and reviews of popular markdown editors and viewers:

- https://github.com/rhythmus/markdown-resources

- http://mashable.com/2013/06/24/markdown-tools

Obsidian is pretty cool though, so try it out.

### Clone and view locally

To explore this repository locally or to integrate it into a service, first clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/doctorfree/Obsidian-Snippets.git
```

This will result in a local folder, `Obsidian-Snippets`, containing all of the markdown and supporting file assets. Import these into your markdown viewer. The import method varies from viewer to viewer. To import into Obsidian:

- Open another vault (or create new vault if first time)
- Open folder as vault (click "Open")
- Navigate to the `Obsidian-Snippets` folder created by `git clone ...`
- Click "Open" to create the new Obsidian vault
